## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Senior Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience in building intelligent AI-driven solutions. Throughout my career, I have designed, developed, and deployed end-to-end machine learning pipelines, working on diverse real-world projects across industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and retail. My core expertise lies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI. I love transforming raw data into meaningful insights using tools like Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I also have strong experience in data visualization and BI using Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio. I am deeply passionate about open-source collaboration, AI research, and building human + AI-powered systems. Currently, I am exploring the intersection of GenAI, multimodal learning. Outside of work, I enjoy speaking at tech meetups, creating AI tutorials, and experimenting with new LLM architectures. Feel free to connect if you'd like to collaborate on AI projects, mentorship!
